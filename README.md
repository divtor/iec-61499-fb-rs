# iec-61499-fb-rs
Implementation of a basic function block according to the IEC 61499 standard.

Goal(s) of this project are:
- [ ] evaluate different approaches to implement IEC 61499 based function blocks in Rust
- [ ] implement a basic function block with voting functionality
- [ ] (If there is time) research an implement how to convert the implementation to WebAssembly
- [ ] (Optionally) research how to generate valid Rust function blocks from structured text representations of function blocks
